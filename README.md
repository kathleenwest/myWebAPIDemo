My Web API Demo:

This is a simple ASP.NET Web API that also demonstrates a RESTful api. It will calculate and return lucky lottery numbers based on either a default (api/values/) or custom HTTP Get Request (example: values?name=Kathleen&age=36) with TWO input parameters in the request.

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. A web API is an application programming interface (API) for either a web server or a web browser. ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework.

How to Access API

default (http://...../api/values/)

custom HTTP Get Request (example: http://....../values?name=Kathleen&age=36) 

Notes: This was one of my first experimental web api projects. I did not add documentation for the API (help) on the web server. This project was done in only a few hours. I've since taken a Web API course and will demo/add better projects in the future.
